// Inheritance
//Allows an object to inherit features from a parent object
var inner = {first: "Mercury", second: "Venus", third: "Earth", fourth: "Mars", fifth: "Jupiter"};
var system = {sixth: "Saturn", seventh: "Uranus", eighth: "Neptune"};
Object.setPrototypeOf(system, inner);
//"system" has now inherited "inner" properties, while still maintaining its own properties
//Now, the properties of system would look like this:

system.first: "Mercury"
system.second: "Venus"
system.third: "Earth"
system.fourth: "Mars"
system.fifth: "Jupiter"
system.sixth: "Saturn"
system.seventh: "Uranus"
system.eighth: "Neptune"

//and sometimes Pluto


//Properties
// Properties are values that are connected with an object. They are made up of a key name and a value
// and are used to define the characteristics of the object

var cropData = new object();
cropData.getWheatInStore = "500"
cropData.getPopulation = "300"
cropData.getAcresOwned = "1000"




//Methods
// actions that can be performed by an object and are stored in an object as a function to run, instead of a value.
